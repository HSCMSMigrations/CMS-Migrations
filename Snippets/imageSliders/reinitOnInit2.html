<!--
This is a variation of reinitOnInit1.js, which is the preferred method. That snippet will actually destroy the initialized slider and then reinitialize it with custom settings. This snippet sneaks your custom code in before the Gallery module's code. And so when the Gallery module tries to initialize, it errors. This creates a console error, which is a little messy. I'd prefer that you use reinitOnInit1.js unless it doesn't work. Then try this method.

Notes:

 - If you're only trying to change a few settings or to add a handful of settings, I would suggest copying over all of the slider's existing options. You can do this by heading into the source code for the page you're working on. Do a search for hsslick and you should see the initialization function. It will look something like:

 $("#hs_cos_gallery_module_1489481802803590").hsSlick(
	{"infinite":true,"autoplay":true,"autoplaySpeed":5000.0,"adaptiveHeight":false,"arrows":true,"dots":true,"lazyLoad":"ondemand","asNavFor":"#hs_cos_gallery_module_1489481802803590 .hs_cos_gallery_thumbnails","displayMode":"standard","fade":false,"lightboxRows":3}
);

Just copy those over (and if you're nice, format nicely like how I have in my code above) into the slickSettings variable. And then add or edit your own settings.
