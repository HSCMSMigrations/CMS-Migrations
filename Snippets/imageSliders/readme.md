This is a collection of snippets related to the HubSpot Gallery module. It's a repackage of Slick Slider. The HubSpot repository is here: https://git.hubteam.com/HubSpot/slick. The documentation for Slick Slider lives here: http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/. And on GitHub: https://github.com/kenwheeler/slick.

There are snippets here that will help you:
1. pause a slick slider on-page
2. set your own custom settings (as opposed to being limited to the module options)
3. get or set your own options on-page
4. get all of the slider's options on-page
