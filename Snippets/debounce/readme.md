# Debounce Function

**Purpose:** you can use the debounce function to improve page performance when using taxing event listeners such as resize and scroll by reducing the amount of times the JavaScript function needs to fire.

## Instructions

When using event listeners that have to fire frequently such as scroll or resize, add the function in the debounce.js file to the main JavaScript file for the migration. Then reference the functionToDebounce.js file when creating your event listener in the main JavaScript file for the migration so that it uses debounce.
