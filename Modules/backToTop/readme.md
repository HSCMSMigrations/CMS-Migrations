# Back to Top

This module can be used on a page or blog post, to display a minimally styled back to top button that shows after the user scrolls down 20px from the top of the window.

The module leverages a JavaScript debounce function to reduce the rate at which the scroll function can fire which should optimize the module for websites. More information on the debounce function can be found here: https://davidwalsh.name/javascript-debounce-function
